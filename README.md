Fixes & Improvements:
1. Need to learn how to code presentable plots (using FacetGrid) <br>
2. Still confused on how to get into the loop of improvement and testing iteration and when to get out of it <br>
( Iteration loop of trying and testing new techniques and preprocessing techniques along with model tunning ) <br>
3. Deploy it on a Cloud Service<br>
4. Not necessary to use always the TOP performing Model ( Fine tuning and deployment use cases and scenarios also decide which model to go with!)
5. Still the intuition of when to drop and what to drop and calculating its impact is lacking while building a baseline model for a problem.
